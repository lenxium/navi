# NAVI Simulator V1.6.1
## Introduction
This is a unique pathfinding algorithm simulator that integrates dynamic maze generation using the randomised Prim algorithm, providing an environment of varying complexity to visualise and compare the efficiency of different algorithms, including A*, Dijkstra, Depth-First and Breadth-First search. The simulator features a minimalist interface, manual exploration of maze modes, and performance analysis tools for in-depth algorithm efficiency comparisons in varying complex mazes. It also includes a login registration system to track the user's maze exploration progress (more features may be included in the future)
## Compilation Environment
This project was compiled and passed under Windows. The required environment is python3, and the library used to write the GUI is Pygame. Before running the program, you need to configure the dependencies, that is, open cmd under the path of main.py and run:

```cmd
pip install –r requirement.txt
```

After configuring the dependencies, you can run the program:
```cmd
python main.py
```
